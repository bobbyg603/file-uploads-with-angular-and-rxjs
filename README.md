# File Uploads with Angular and RxJS

This is is a companion repo for [File Uploads with Angular and RxJS](https://betterprogramming.pub/file-uploads-with-angular-and-rxjs-34262b3450ae). The article demonstrates how to make a file upload component with the Angular HttpClient, Bootstrap progress bars, and RxJS observables with subscriptions that complete automatically.
