This is is a companion repo for [File Uploads with Angular and RxJS](https://betterprogramming.pub/file-uploads-with-angular-and-rxjs-34262b3450ae). The article demonstrates how to make a file upload component with the Angular HttpClient, Bootstrap progress bars, and RxJS observables with subscriptions that complete automatically.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo to your workspace:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bobbyg603/file-uploads-with-angular-and-rxjs
```

Install the dependencies and start the application:

```sh
cd file-uploads-with-angular-and-rxjs && npm i && npm start
```

You will also need to clone the companion Express server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bobbyg603/upload-server
```

Install the dependencies and start the server:

```sh
cd upload-server && npm i && npm start
```

Use the drag and drop control or click "Browse Files" to select files to upload:


## Further Exploration

Want to use this component in a production scenario? Take a look the [upload-client](https://github.com/bobbyg603/upload-client) repo.

The upload client repository takes this example and adds a Navbar, a modal, a loading wheel, error handling, and more!
